The PyScript Collective is: software and people, from and for the PyScript Community.

# Helping Learners and Contributors

We want PyScript to be a great onboarding vehicle for Python, data science, and web coding.
Fortunately a lot of folks want to help too!
The Collective is a community project to organize everything about PyScript (and related projects like Pyodide) into useful collections.

Things we work on:

## The `awesome-pyscript` Page

Awesome PyScript is an organized, curated, and updated collection of every…damn…thing.
If you have an example, put it up somewhere and let us know.
We’ll list it (terms and conditions apply.)
Same for an article, a video, a conference talk, whatever.

We’ll list it, but we won’t stand behind it. We’ll remove it if we’re told it’s no longer good, but that’s it.
Not much of a “stamp of approval."

If you’re looking for a collection of quality, working, maintained stuff, then that would be…

## PyScript Gallery

People like to learn by runnable-example, and PyScript is great for this -- a UI in a browser, yummy.
People also like to *share* running examples.

We're the group that packages up community examples into a slick, quality web app called the PyScript Gallery.
It's a page on a website (here), but it's also a locally-runnable Python application and package.

It's not all just software, though.
The Collective has a larger purpose: education.

## Contributors and Collaborators

The Collective is a shared-responsibility repo of resources, such as examples.
As such, it is *also* a group of maintainers who help stuff come in, help clean it up, help teach people, then stand behind what goes in.
We’ll fix bugs, refactor examples if PyScript changes, answer tickets, etc.

Even better, we help contributors *join* the Collective and become collaborators.
And those new contributors can then help the next person.
We want the Collective to become a joyful place where people are **valued and valuable**.
Where new coders become the next generation of stars.
Hell, we want people to list it on their resume, where the Collective helps them land a job.

As such, the Collective has a higher bar. It isn’t fair to the maintainers for new contributors to do a “dump and run.” We’ll require: tests, docstrings, and perhaps some code quality tools (flake8, black.) Why? To make it easy to maintain, but also to be shining code examples for learners.

## Incubator

The “Incubator” is the in-between stage. Stuff that’s on its way in, isn’t ready to get a permanent commitment yet. Perhaps it’s the code: needs cleaning up, doesn’t use the right idioms. Perhaps its the contributor: they aren’t sure yet if they are around for the long-haul and the maintainers don’t feel comfortable holding the bag.
Stuff in the “incubator” might not be listed publicly. Such as...


## Will This Work?

It’s kind of ambitious, in a social way.
Will we get contributors?
Maintainers?
Will people want to join?

We think so.
Rather, we very-much hope so.
We’d like PyScript to be a vehicle for crazy-cool innovation, growth, and togetherness, similar to how data science impacted Python.

## Kinda Vague, What Specifically?

- We’ll get a bootstrapping set of maintainers who commit to building the machinery (easy testing, GitHub Actions, flake8 etc., Sphinx output, Awesome PyScript Markdown page) and closing tickets

- Collect all the existing known resources into the Awesome PyScript page

- Make it clear the process to contribute to Awesome PyScript

- Start processing our own examples through the process to see how well it works

- Create a super-slick Gallery app

- Make it clear the process to contribute to the Collective

- See if anybody wants their examples in the Collective, perhaps to join us
